# Positivus

## Objective

It's been a while since I last had to develop a website based on a Figma design. The last time was during my internship last summer. For most of my projects, I usually skip creating a Figma design and instead start developing the sites right away, using layouts from other sites I found interesting at the time. This is why I wanted to polish my skills by coding based on a Figma design created by someone else, mimicking how a client would ask me to build a website for them.

## Credits

This Figma design is the first one I found after searching for a free website design on Google.
It was illustrated by Igor Kapustin.
